Current version: **0.9.0**

## About
This takes ESPN+ and transforms it into a "live TV" experience with virtual linear channels. It will discover what is on, and generate a schedule of channels that will give you M3U and XMLTV files that you can import into something like Jellyfin or VLC.

#### Notes
* This was not made for pirating streams. This is made for using your own credentials and have a different presentation than the ESPN+ app currently gives.
* Currently this software is in a very beta state. It hasn't been fully tested and relies on some lame workarounds to get the data needed to start a stream. There are some questions about how boundies work when a scheduled entry ends or when a new entry starts if it will pick it up automatically.
* The Mouse might not like it and it could be taken down at any minute. Enjoy it while it lasts. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Using
The server exposes 2 main endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| /channels.m3u | The channel list you'll import into your client |
| /xmltv.xml | The schedule that you'll import into your client |

## Running
The recommended way of running is to pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m0ngr31/eplustv).

### Docker Setup

#### Environement Variables
| Environment Variable | Description | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| ACCESS_URI | What accessable URL your clients will be connecting from. For example: `http://192.168.0.1:8000` | Yes |
| ESPN_USER | Your ESPN+ Username | Yes |
| ESPN_PASS | Your ESPN+ Password | Yes |
| START_CHANNEL | What the first channel number should be. Keep in mind this generates 100 channels to keep a healthy buffer. | No. If not set, the start channel will default to 1. |
| PORT | What port the server should expose itself on | No. If not set, the port will default to 8000. |


#### Volumes
| Volume Name | Description | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| /app/config | Used to store DB and application state. | No. But channel schedules will not be persisted. |
| /app/tmp | Used to store temporary segments generated by the streams. Recommended to use something like `/dev/shm`. | No |


#### Docker Run
By default, the easiest way to get running is:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /config_dir:/app/config -v /dev/shm:/app/tmp -e ACCESS_URI='http://192.168.0.10:8000' -e ESPN_USER='...' -e ESPN_PASS='...'  m0ngr31/eplustv
```
